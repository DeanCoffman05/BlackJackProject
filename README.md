# BlackJackProject

# Description

This amazing program produces an interactive game of Blackjack. In this game, the player is given several options based on the shuffled deck of cards supplied. Once the player has finished 
their hand, the dealer uses their programmed logic to attempt to win the game! The person closest or at 21 wins the game. Once the first hand is finished the game recycles until the player 
chooses to exit the game.

# Lessons Learned
Working with this program was a turning point in my programming career. The use of method call, method creation, logic, and true encapsulation were grasped in ways I hadn't before. I was able
 to gain a lot of insight into the planning process of a software developer. The ability to bring English written word to coded reality was a fun and eye opening experience. I genuinely enjoyed 
 this project and look forward to a career full of more.
